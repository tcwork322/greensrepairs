This website is a bike repair/purchase refurbishied or second hand bikes shop, it doesn't need to have real data or an admin panel, or contact forms, just ways for people to get in touch

It can be built in pure HTML/JS/CSS as it is just a prototype to show to a client

So I would like a navigation, homepage explaining how to get in touch about repairs or a link to the contact page, a shop page with a list of bikes (just a random selection would do of maybe around 16 with pagination on 12), prices/titles and featured images on the listing page

On the single bike page, a standard e-commerce layout with images on the left in a carousel (install Swiper.js if necessary), and on the right, the title, the price, the specifications etc, these specifications should be accurate to the bike shown though as although this is demo data, it still needs to be correct, hopefully there's an API or a list online or something that can give us bike information then I can find the images myself

If there are resources for stock photos online with no watermark and we can get bike pictures from them for the components on the pages, that would be appreciated
