# Bike images – required files and sources

Place image files in **`images/bikes/`**. Each bike uses one main image (the carousel repeats it until you add more). Use **JPG** or **PNG**; the site expects `.jpg` – rename if needed.

**Current state:** Placeholder images are in place (Surron Ultra Bee and Storm Bee use generated product-style images; others use temporary copies of existing bike photos). Replace any file with an accurate photo when you have one.

## Required filenames

| Filename | Bike |
|----------|------|
| `surron-light-bee-x.jpg` | Surron Light Bee X |
| `surron-ultra-bee.jpg` | Surron Ultra Bee |
| `surron-storm-bee.jpg` | Surron Storm Bee |
| `surron-light-bee-l1e.jpg` | Surron Light Bee L1e (Road Legal) |
| `specialized-turbo-vado-50.jpg` | Specialized Turbo Vado 5.0 |
| `trek-allant-7.jpg` | Trek Allant+ 7 |
| `cube-kathmandu-hybrid-pro-625.jpg` | Cube Kathmandu Hybrid Pro 625 |
| `haibike-allmtn-7.jpg` | Haibike AllMtn 7 |

## Where to get accurate images

### Surron (electric dirt bikes)
- **Official product images (reference / press):** [surron.com](https://surron.com) – Light Bee X, Ultra Bee, Storm Bee pages. Check terms for use of official assets.
- **Free stock (generic electric dirt bike):** [Unsplash – dirt bike](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dirt-bike), [Unsplash – electric bike](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/electric-bike). Search “electric dirt bike” or “Surron” for closer matches.

### E-bikes (Specialized, Trek, Cube, Haibike)
- **Manufacturer sites:** Product pages often have high-res images; confirm licensing before use.
- **Free stock:** [Unsplash – electric bike](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/electric-bike), [Pexels – electric bicycle](https://www.pexels.com/search/electric%20bicycle/). Use model-specific searches where possible.

### Optional: extra carousel images
To show 2–3 different angles per bike, add files like `surron-light-bee-x-2.jpg`, `surron-light-bee-x-3.jpg` and update the `images` array for that bike in `js/bikes-data.js`.

### Licensing
- **Unsplash / Pexels:** Free for commercial use; no attribution required (check each image’s licence).
- **Manufacturer images:** Often restricted; use only if you have rights or permission.
